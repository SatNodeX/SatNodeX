# SatNodeX: Solana SDR Broadcast & Receive

**Broadcast and receive Solana transactions without internet using Software Defined Radio (SDR).** This project provides a setup to transmit and receive Solana blockchain transactions over radio frequencies, enabling decentralized communication in offline environments.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** Transmitting radio signals may require appropriate licenses in your country. Ensure you comply with all local regulations before proceeding.

  - [USRP](https://www.ettus.com/all-products/)
- **Antenna:** Suitable for your chosen frequency bands.
- **Computer:** Capable of running SDR software and handling Solana node operations.

### Software

- **SDR Software:**  
  - [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/)  
  - [SDR# (SDRSharp)](https://airspy.com/download/)  
  - [GQRX](https://gqrx.dk/)
- **Solana CLI:**  
  - [Install Solana CLI Tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- **Programming Environment:**  
  - Python (with libraries like `pysdr`) or other scripting languages.
- **Custom Scripts:** For encoding/decoding Solana transactions into radio signals.

### Knowledge

- **Radio Communication Principles:** Understanding of modulation, frequency bands, and signal processing.
- **Solana Blockchain:** Familiarity with Solana’s architecture and transaction structures.
- **Programming Skills:** Ability to script and automate processes, preferably in Python.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Set Up Your Solana Environment

**Install Solana CLI:**

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"

Initialize a Solana Wallet:

solana-keygen new

Run a Local Solana Validator (Optional):

For operating in a private network:

solana-test-validator

2. Configure Your SDR Hardware

Connect SDR Device:

Ensure your SDR transceiver is properly connected to your computer and recognized by your operating system.

Install Necessary Drivers:

Depending on your SDR device, install the appropriate drivers. For example, for HackRF:
	•	HackRF Drivers Installation Guide

3. Develop Encoding Scheme for Transactions

Serialize Solana Transactions:

Use Solana’s SDK to serialize transactions into a byte format.

from solana.transaction import Transaction

# Create and serialize transaction
transaction = Transaction()
serialized_tx = transaction.serialize()

Modulate Data for Radio Transmission:

Choose a modulation scheme (e.g., FSK, QPSK). Utilize GNU Radio to design the modulation process.

Implement Error Correction:

Incorporate error correction (e.g., Reed-Solomon) to ensure data integrity over radio.

4. Transmit Transactions via SDR

Create Transmission Script:

Example using Python with GNU Radio:

from gnuradio import gr, analog, digital

class TxFlowGraph(gr.top_block):
    def __init__(self, data):
        super().__init__()
        # Define sources, modulators, and sinks
        self.packet_mod = digital.packet_mod(...)
        self.sig_source = analog.sig_source(...)
        # Connect blocks
        self.connect(self.packet_mod, self.sig_source)

# Initialize and start the flowgraph with serialized transaction
tb = TxFlowGraph(serialized_tx)
tb.start()

Transmit the Signal:

Execute your transmission script, ensuring you’re operating on the correct frequency and within legal power limits.

5. Receive Transactions via SDR

Create Reception Script:

Set up a flowgraph to receive and demodulate the signal.

from gnuradio import gr, analog, digital

class RxFlowGraph(gr.top_block):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Define sources, demodulators, and sinks
        self.sig_source = analog.sig_source(...)
        self.packet_demod = digital.packet_demod(...)
        # Connect blocks
        self.connect(self.sig_source, self.packet_demod)

# Initialize and start the flowgraph
tb = RxFlowGraph()
tb.start()

Decode and Deserialize Transactions:

Extract the byte data from the demodulated signal and deserialize it back into Solana transactions.

deserialized_tx = Transaction.deserialize(received_data)

6. Integrate with Solana Network

Broadcast Transactions:

Without internet, consider the following options:
	•	Local Validator: If running a local validator, submit transactions directly.

solana transfer <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> --from <KEYPAIR>


	•	Mesh Network: Set up a local mesh network of Solana nodes communicating via radio.

7. Testing and Validation

Verify Transmission:

Ensure that transactions are correctly transmitted and received by performing test transactions.

Monitor Solana Network:

Check the status of transactions on your validator or local network to confirm successful integration.

Considerations and Tips
	•	Frequency Selection:
Choose appropriate frequency bands for data transmission. Common ISM bands (e.g., 2.4 GHz) are unlicensed but verify local regulations.
	•	Data Rate and Bandwidth:
Balance data rate with reliability. Higher data rates require more bandwidth and better signal quality.
	•	Security:
Implement encryption to secure transaction data transmitted over radio.
	•	Legal Compliance:
Always adhere to local laws regarding radio transmissions to avoid interference with licensed services.
	•	Range and Reliability:
Radio transmissions are subject to environmental factors. Use appropriate antennas and possibly repeaters to enhance range and reliability.
